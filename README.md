# Project2-STM-Analysis-of-Total-Cholestrol-Level
> **Brief Description:** The program analyzes spread of Total-Cholestrol-Level readings from mean value. A greater deviation from mean values greater risk of heart attack which is seen for the group of patients leading a unhealthy and unregulated life.

## Description

The program analyzes spread of total chlolestrol level readings from mean value. A greater deviation from mean values greater risk of heart attack which is seen for the group leading unhealthy and unregulated life. Where as the other group who do regular exercises and lead a controlled life have less fluctuations in his cholestrol level.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data set is synthetically generated and used for demonstrating the concept only. The program can be easily modified to show results with real readings taken from the patients.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below.
